This file gethers together all of the steps in processing an image that are defined 
in the other four classes.

First, the program stops and describes the error if there is no video feed. Then, it 
initializes the object of class History with a starting frame. For each subsequent 
frame, the image is passed to a Frame object. Lines are extracted using an object of 
class LineGroupList, and the History object is updated using the result. For each frame,
the map of the ROV's progress is shown.
