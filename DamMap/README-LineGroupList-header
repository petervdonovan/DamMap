This header file defines the class LineGroupList, which is used to get
and store a list of lines that are categorized by their angle and proximity
to each other.

To use this class, pass a Frame object to a LineGroupList. A call to the
method getGroupsOfLines() gets a 2-dimensional vector of lines, with lines
that are close to each other and at similar angles grouped together.
