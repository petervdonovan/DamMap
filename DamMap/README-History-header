This header file defines the class History, which stores LineSimplified objects
and monitors their motion across the camera's field of view to map the ROV's 
motion between squares of the grid.

To use this class, define a History object at the beginning of the program and 
pass the dimensions of the frame. Then, pass groups of lines for each frame that
is to be processed so that their locations are updated.

A call to the method show() opens a new window mapping the path of the ROV.
