Frame is the class used to do initial processing of the image as a whole, 
before any black gridlines are extracted from it.

This processing is completed upon creation of the Frame object by the 
constructor so that calls to getter methods can access it without any 
repeated processing.

The current image from the ROV's cameras should be passed to the constructor. The 
constructor then internally calls private methods to get areas of the image
that could be gridlines, subtract the red path and shadows from those areas,
and then use the result to ignore all parts of the Canny edge detection
that are not in the right area.

The method getFinalCanny() is the method that is needed to finish processing 
a frame. The other methods are used for debugging intermediate steps in the 
program.
