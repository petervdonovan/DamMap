An object of class LineGroupList requires the output of the 
HoughLinesP function from the OpenCV library.

Most processing is completed in the constructor. The purpose is
to sort through the 1-dimensional vector of lines provided and group
similar lines together by placing them in a 2-dimensional vector.

These groups of lines can be shown in an image in a new window for 
debugging.

It is then possible to get this line group and assume all lines that
are grouped together to be part of the same feature in the image.
