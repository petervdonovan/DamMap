This header file defines the class LineSimplified, which analyzes groups of 
lines to get and store basic descriptors of that group of lines over time. 

To use this class, pass a vector of similar lines to a new LineSimplified 
object. Then, when there is a new frame of video and there is a group of lines 
that may represent the same feature of the image, pass them to the 
update() in a vector. If they are likely to be the same vector, the update()
method returns true and a new position of that feature is recorded.
