A class for simplifying lines found in the image into something that can more
easily be processed. Based on a vector of lines that are similar to each other,
the algorithm combines them into one line, classifies it as either horizontal 
or vertical, and determines its distance from the origin (the top left corner of
the camera's view).

To use this class, pass the object a vector of lines that are close to each other.
It can be used to determine whether a line has moved across the view of the camera
and to track changes in its distance from the origin.
